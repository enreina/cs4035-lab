# Assignment Lab 2 - Anomaly Detection

## Requirements

The code was written for Python 3.6.6 with Jupyter Notebook. Some requirements can be installed using `pip` (or `pip3` if you have separate pip for Python 3):

```
pip install pyramid-arima
pip install statsmodels
pip install scikit_learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

## The Dataset & Preloaded Files
You should put the dataset in the `dataset` folder (included), and also some files in the `output` which should allow you to run the code more quickly, skipping time consuming process.

## Running the code
You would need to run in in Jupyter, so run jupyter:

```
jupyter notebook
```

and open each of the following .ipynb files for the respective task:

1. [Familiarization_and_ARMA.ipynb](https://github.com/enreina/cs4035-lab/blob/master/lab2/Familiarization_and_ARMA.ipynb)
2. [Discretization.ipynb](https://github.com/enreina/cs4035-lab/blob/master/lab2/Discretization.ipynb)
3. [PCA_task.ipynb](https://github.com/enreina/cs4035-lab/blob/master/lab2/PCA_task.ipynb)
